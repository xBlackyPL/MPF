Simplified version of my implementation of BBPSO.

It needs GSL (GNU Scientific Library) to be installed.
(download,./configure;make;make install).

For more information about my code see comments in an example code (main.c).
To make everything you need to make library (make lib) and then example (make example).

To make libpso type: 

make lib

To make a simple but interesting example type:

make example  

To make example with fortran target function type:

make example2

To make example with fortran function used by C library 
in fortran progam (uff..) type:

make example3
